                    <p >My name is Danielle Kuhn and I am a front-end developer with full-stack experience. I entered the tech industry about five years ago when 
                    I founded a <a style={{color: "black", textDecoration: "underline"}} href="https://pingpongpayments.com/">Fintech company</a> because I love solving complex problems, especially through the use of technology. Throughout that journey I realized 
                    that I am enamored with engineering challenges and what can be accomplished with code. It became my goal and passion to learn how to build software like we had created for our customers and I've
                    have been creating applications ever since! </p>
                    <p>Prior to entering the tech space, I was an actuary for six years after graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Even as an actuary, I always gravitated to the more technical parts of the profession and loved developing complex actuarial models.  </p>
                    <p>In order to take my engineering skills to the next level, I recently spent the last four months building software applications with other developers at Hack Reactor. I had the incredible opportunity to advance my JavaScript and React skills along with diving into a variety of other technologies. 
                    I'm looking for an entry-level, front-end developer position where I can contribute to building world-class applications with great people!</p>
